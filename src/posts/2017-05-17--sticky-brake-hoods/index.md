So, as I mentioned in my [opening article](https://electic.test/beginning-again/), I hadn't ridden my bike in over fifteen years. Both of my bikes remained in unheated or air-conditioned storage, either a garage or storage buildings. After deciding to ride again, bike maintenance was a real issue ... gluing on more tires (more on that later), new derailleur cables, new pedals, and the list went on. I was able to ride again.

I did notice the the brake hoods were kind of sticky. Even new, the white brake hoods were hard to keep clean so I assumed they need to be cleaned once again with some trusty Soft Scrub. Just as I was returning home from my third ride the right side brake hood ripped in my hand. After I investigated both of the brake hood, and inspected my other bike, I realized the problem - twelve years of heat literally broke down the brake hoods. As I started looking for a replacement I realized how hard it is to find replacement parts for what was now classified as a vintage bike.

### Vintage Parts

So, I was able to do a web search for 1989 Shimano 105 brake hoods and all sorts of results came up as you can imagine. I came across a wonderful find called Velobase. According to their web site:

> The goal of VeloBase.com is to provide a comprehensive database of vintage cycling knowledge for reference during everything from restorations to general maintenance to researching the cycling history through the equipment of the time.

A quick search and I found out that the groupset had a separate model number "1050." After another search I was able to find a pair of new replica brake hoods at [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GSMSJG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer) of all places. They are black instead of the original white but I never was crazy about the white anyway. Off to ride again with clean brake hoods.
