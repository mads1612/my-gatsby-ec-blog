So it begins ... or beginning again. In a galaxy far, far away ... or way back in 1989, at the age of 27 years old or in cycle terms, old age, I started competitive cycling. I loved this adventure and my weeks were consumed with cycling. When I wasn't training or racing, I was eating and resting, so I could train and race the next day. I lived and breathed cycling and met some wonderful people along the way that I have somehow lost touch with over the years. After 10 years of cycling, it was over; gone like a flash in the night. I got busy with life - with decisions made, self-employed in a bad economy, relocating, and eventually starting a new family. My two bikes, resided in a storage building, as a reminder of days that seemed to have gone by.

After a warning from my doctors about worsening diabetes this Spring, cycling started calling me again. When I freshened up my training bike, a 1989 Specialized Sirrus,Â more on this later, I started riding for health. I am planning to share my experience here on this blog so stay tuned for more information.
